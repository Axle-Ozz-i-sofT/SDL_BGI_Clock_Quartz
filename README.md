# SDL_BGI Clock with sdlbgifast() and memory based image  

This version of the Clock is using 1 second ticks but makes use of the faster SDL2 rendering.  
I have also added and example of reading and image file (BMP) into RAM and rendering the memory based image to the screen on each loop cycle.

You will need [SDL2](https://github.com/libsdl-org/SDL) development version and [SDL_Bgi V3](https://sdl-bgi.sourceforge.io/).  
Please read my booklet ["A Beginners Guide To SDL_bgi.pdf"](https://github.com/Axle-Ozz-i-sofT/A-BEGINNERS-GUIDE-TO-PROGRAMMING/tree/main/Supplimental/A%20Beginners_Guide_To_SDL_bgi) for how to set up the library as well as setting up the project in Dev-C++ and Code::Blocks.

At the moment I have only done some C language demos but I am looking at creating some SDL_Bgi demos in both FreeBASIC and Python3 as well.
